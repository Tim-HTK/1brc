# The 1BRC

The "1 Billion Rows Challenge" is a programming challenge with the target of parsing a Textfile with one billion lines (about 12 GB) as fast as possible. [Here](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) is a reference to the original challenge.

## Implementation

This Repository contains multiple implementations with different performance levels. Better implementations will be added step-by-step.

The `create_sample.c` is an implementation of a data generator for the data required in this challenge. Full credits to [https://github.com/dannyvankooten/1brc/blob/main/create-sample.c](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/1brc/blob/main/create-sample.c).
